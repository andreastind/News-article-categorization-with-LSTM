## News article categorization with LSTM architecture

In this project we use a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to categorize news articles.<br>
Articles are classified into 26 different categories (e.g., sports, politics, entertainment) based on their headlines and a short description.<br>
<br>
The project was created as a part of the exam for the course Deep Learning.<br>
Created in December 2021 by Andreas Tind Damgaard and Casper Michael Haurum.
